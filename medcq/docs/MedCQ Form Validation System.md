# MedCQ Form Validation System

This document provides an overview of the form validation system implemented for the MedCQ application.

## Core Concepts

The form validation system is built on three key principles:

1. **Declarative validation rules** - Define validation logic as data structures
2. **Form state management** - Track values, errors, and metadata in a single place
3. **Component integration** - Easily connect form state to UI components

## Validation Rules

Validation rules are simple objects with a test function and error message:

```tsx
// Example validation rule
const required = {
  test: value => value !== undefined && value !== null && value !== '',
  message: 'This field is required'
};
